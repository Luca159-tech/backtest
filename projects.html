            <h3>Memorisation as Path-Finding</h3>
            <p>
              Recall is modelled as graph traversal. Nodes represent concepts. Edges are the
              relationships that allow a retrieval path to form. Dense interconnection improves
              retrieval speed and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Visual and logical encoding outperforms rote repetition. The system encourages
              repeated activation of neighbouring nodes to strengthen memory pathways while
              highlighting weak or unused connections that decay.
            </p>

            <h3>Logic as Cognitive Routing</h3>
            <p>
              Inspired by flowcharts and decision trees, this project treats logic gates (AND, OR,
              NOT) as cognitive filters. They route memory pathways, determine retrieval rules, and
              enable programmable recall.
            </p>
            <p>
              The long-term vision is a SaaS platform where users build memory systems using logic
              primitives. Learning becomes programmable. This site lays the conceptual groundwork
              for that future direction.
