# Memory Systems Lab

## Project Purpose
Memory Systems Lab is a conceptual site exploring how structured logic, graphs, and system design can improve human recall. It presents the groundwork for building cognitive infrastructure rather than isolated productivity tools.

## Philosophy
- Memory is a system, not a list.
- Recall is navigation through a graph of relationships.
- Logic gates and flow structures can become cognitive routing tools.

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Status
This is a foundational prototype intended to evolve into a real product and future SaaS memory platform. The current iteration focuses on clarity, structure, and extensibility, using lightweight visual placeholders instead of bundled binary assets.
