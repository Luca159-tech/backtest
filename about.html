        <h2>Systems Thinking for Human Recall</h2>
        <p>
          I am focused on systems thinking, logic, and the mechanics of human recall. The aim is
          not to build isolated apps, but to engineer cognitive infrastructure &mdash; frameworks
          that shape how knowledge is encoded, routed, and retrieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memorisation fails when structure is missing. Without an explicit map of relationships,
          recall becomes a fragile lookup table. By contrast, a graph-based model exposes the
          pathways between ideas and makes retrieval resilient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logic gates are not only electronic primitives. They are cognitive filters that govern
          how information flows. When combined with graph structures, they become an intentional
          architecture for thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This work stays grounded: precise terminology, observable effects, and a clear focus on
          the tools that can strengthen real-world learning.
