        <h2>Systems Thinking for Human Recall</h2>
        <p>
          I am focused on systems thinking, logic, and the mechanics of human recall. The aim is
          to engineer cognitive infrastructure that shapes how knowledge is encoded, routed, and retrieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memorisation fails when structure is missing. A graph-based model exposes pathways
          between ideas and makes retrieval resilient over time.
        </p>
        <h3>Why this matters</h3>
        <p>
          Logic gates can act as cognitive filters. Combined with graph structures, they support
          intentional architectures for long-term learning.
