          <h1>Engineering Memory Through Structure, Logic, and Visual Systems</h1>
          <p>
            Exploring how humans recall, organise, and extend knowledge using structured logic,
            graphs, and algorithmic thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Memory is treated as a system. Recall becomes navigation. Learning is the act of
            traversing an evolving graph rather than memorising isolated facts.

        <h2>Why Memory Systems?</h2>
        <p>
          This project reframes recall as a directional search problem. Concepts become nodes,
          relationships become edges, and learning becomes the repeated strengthening of the
          pathways between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The focus is on building cognitive infrastructure: tools that shape how we encode,
          traverse, and extend knowledge over time.
